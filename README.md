# Kucoin Volitility Trading Bot

## Description
This project orginally comes from https://github.com/returnsomeday2/Binance-volatility-trading-bot
I wanted to create also short sales and use leverage, but can not use futures trading in germany on Binance, so recreated it for Kucoin.
This Kucoin trading bot analyses the changes in price across allÂ coins on Kucoin and place trades on the most volatile ones. 
In addition to that, this Kucoin trading algorithm will also keep track of all the coins bought and sell them according to your specified Stop Loss and Take Profit.

The bot will listen to changes in price accross all coins on Kucoin. By default, we're only picking USDT pairs. We're excluding Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs

> Information below is an example and is all configurable

- The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes (or  create a custom signal)
- The bot will buy/sell 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Kucoin
- The bot will sell at 6% profit or 3% stop loss (or sell/buy is triggered by custom signal)
